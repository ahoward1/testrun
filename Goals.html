	class="heading">Top 3 Goals</h1>
<p>My first goal is to finish my frontend career path within 3 months. I plan to start communicating with Career Services by the middle of January, 2016. I plan to stay in communication with them until I find a career in Houston.</p>

<p>My second goal is to find a career that would allow me to grow and exceed to my full potential and more within their company. I'm truly excited to be embarking on this journey and I'm even more excited about unlocking doors that were once closed to me.</p>

<p>My third goal is within 5-10 years from now to have a startup in place. I'm currently thinking about what I want it to be. I want to give back and help others succeed in their dreams as well. That's just one idea that I'm currently working on.
